a website meant to help with planning a trip created with expressJs (a nodejs module) for my friend's final project.

it was a *group* project where i did 90% of the actual javascript. the other guys just designed the website and wrote most of the html, putting some ground work for me

the website works with a mongodb database alongside expressJs (and many other modules including bluebird and passport)

this was my first time using expressJs and I learned a lot from working on this. unfortunately I was not really given enough time to get all the features 100% working. 

It was mostly done just as a big favor for a good friend of mine.

features:

*register, login/logout functionality*
*google maps integration*
*a memo book*
*a checklist*
*a calandar*
*all the user's information is saved to the mongo database*

for info on the required modules see app.js
